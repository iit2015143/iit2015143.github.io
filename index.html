				<p>Hi guys ! This is anurag and to introduce me I would first
					say that I am from Bihar yeah I had thought first that I
					would say India but I don't think other nationals would
					visit this.(LOL). </p>
				<p>Currently I am studying in IIIT-Allahabad
					and I am not very good at academics but I do experiment
					with different sort of things.I have passed my 12th board
					from GGPS public school Bokaro and my 10th board was from D.A.V.
					Public School, Lakhisarai.
				</p>
				<p>
					Talking about my social life I am not very friendly yeah i have
					some good old friends but now my image recently has emerged out
					as an introvert among people around. May be because i don't
					socialize more, anyways I am not an introvert and in leg pulling
					I am excellent.

				<h1 id = "interests"><span>Interests<span></h1>
				<p>Talking on a broader sense I am very much interested in
					technology and how do the things around actually work, I play
					badminton, I tried swimming too, I am not good at it but
					swimming pool fascinates me so much, I like being there. I like
					making fun of my friends too and I tear my best friends apart not
					actually but by making real fun of them.<br /><br />
					In technological aspects my main focus is towards web development
					, android app development and I have also worked in IOT as the
					results of my iot project were very much praised so I am kind of
					more concerned about it.

				<h1 id = "skills"><span>Skills<span></h1>
				<p>As I was a complete novice in the field of computer science or i will
					say computers till 2015, when I got into my college I literally knew
					nothing even switching on a desktop was a tough thing for me, and was
					a big achievement when i had done it first <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>
					<br /><br />
					As I found it shameful as my batchmates were far ahead of me I started
					aquiring skills in different fields of computer and now check out the list:
					<br/> <br/>
					<ul>
						<li>IOT</li>
						<li>Html</li>
